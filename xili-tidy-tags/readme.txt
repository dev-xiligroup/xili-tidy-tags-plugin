xili-tidy-tags is a tool for grouping tags by semantic groups or by language and for creating tidy tag clouds.

== Description ==

= on monolingual website (blog or CMS) =
xili-tidy-tags is a tool for grouping tags by semantic groups and sub-groups.
This tags aggregator can also, by instance, be used to group tags according two or more main parts of the CMS website. It is also possible to create group of tags in parallel of category and display a ‘sub’ tag cloud only depending of the displayed category.

= on multilingual website =
xili-tidy-tags is a tool for grouping tags by language with xili-language plugin for multilingual site and for creating tidy tag clouds. By instance to present only tags in english when the theme is in english because the post or the current category present texts in english. Technically, as xili-language, this plugin don't create tables in wordpress db. He only use (rich) taxonomy features. So, with or without the plugin, the base structure is not modified.

= Why xili-tidy-tags versus / against included parent property of terms ? =

With default parent feature, a tag (term) can have only one parent. The default taxonomy (see file taxonomy.php in folder wp-includes) is very poweful but don't include the queries to group tags under one another tag. Is is the purpose of this plugin xili-tidy-tags created since WP 2.7 ! Initially created to group tags by language, he structurally contains all functions to group tags by semantic groups AND one tag can belong to one or more groups.

= Why xili-tidy-tags introduces grouping features since version 1.9 ? =
**RESERVED for DEVELOPERS using template-tags**
Using nice feature "alias of" and "group" of WP core taxonomy.php, xili-tidy-tags offers now a way to "link" tags of different languages (red, rouge, rot,…). So when displaying list of french posts associated with a french tag (*rouge*), it is now possible to show a list of tags in other languages (*red, rouge, rot,…*) and visitor is now able to click on *red* and show the webpage of list of posts tagged with *red*. Only taxonomy wpdb tables are used, no new tables, no new lines in options table.

= Widget to insert Tags cloud =
The powerful widget is easy to setup and to choose what and when group of tags to display.

= Template tags usable in theme design =
Template tags are provided to enrich the theme and display sub-selection of tags.
Through the settings admin UI, it is possible to assign to a tag one or more groups (by instance a french tag to the french language group. A trademark term like WordPress to a group named "trademark". You can choose different storage policies.

**NEW 2 template-tags since 1.9 :** `xili_tidy_tags_group_links` to show the group of tags containing the current tag (useful in tag.php of theme) and `xili_tidy_tag_in_other_lang` to return info (link) of one other tag of the group in an another lang. Xili-language version > 2.9.0 will use the links switching in language switching navigation menu when displaying tag.php page. (if "red" tag page is displayed, language menu for french will link to "rouge" !)

= Shortcode =
add shortcode inside a post content to include in your text a cloud of a group of tags.

**Example of shortcode :**  `[xili-tidy-tags params="tagsgroup=trademark&largest=10&smallest=10" glue=" | "]`
In this cas, the group of tags named 'trademark' will be display inside a paragraph of a post. The params are defined as in `xili_tidy_tag_cloud()` and as in `wp_tag_cloud()`. The glue is chars inserted between the tags (if omitted default is a space).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder containing `xili-tidy-tags.php` and others files to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory,

3. in theme, a new template tag is available : `xili_tidy_tag_cloud` Same passed values as tag_cloud but two new : tagsgroup and tagsallgroup . tagsallgroup can be the parent group slug, tagsgroup is one of the child group slug. If one or both are included, the cloud is built with sub-selected tags in this (theses) group(s).


**Exemples of script in sidebar.php :**

= with xili-language plugin activated in multilingual website =
`
<div><h2><?php _e('Tags cloud','xilidev');?></h2>
<?php if (function_exists('xili_tidy_tag_cloud') && class_exists('xili_language')) xili_tidy_tag_cloud('tagsgroup='.the_curlang().'&tagsallgroup=tidy-languages-group&largest=18'); ?>
</div>
`

= with semantic group named as category and a group containing trademarks named trademark =
`
<h2><?php _e('Tags cloud','xilidev');?></h2><?php
if (function_exists('xili_tidy_tag_cloud')) xili_tidy_tag_cloud('tagsgroup='.single_cat_title('',false).'&tagsallgroup=trademark&largest=18'); ?>
</div>
`
= example of a splitted tag cloud of authors group (here separated by hr) - change html tags if you want to build a table with 3 columns =
`
<div><h2><?php _e('Tags clouds','xilidev');?></h2><?php if (function_exists('xili_tidy_tag_cloud')) xili_tidy_tag_cloud('tagsgroup=authors&largest=18&&number=15'); ?>
<hr />
<?php if (function_exists('xili_tidy_tag_cloud')) xili_tidy_tag_cloud('tagsgroup=authors&largest=18&&offset=15&number=15'); ?>

</div>
`
